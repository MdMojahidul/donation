                hands and benefit himself and also give in charity (from what he earns).”</h4>

                Our supporters can send the message that it's wrong for politically connected corporations to make
                millions while people doing an honest day's work are being cheated out of an honest day's pay.

                We are born at a given moment, in a given place and, like vintage years of wine, we have the qualities
                of the year and of the season of which we are born. Astrology does not lay claim to anything more.
